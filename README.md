Gesture Care is an IoT-based system designed to help individuals with physical or communication challenges control home appliances and express their basic needs through hand gestures. Using a glove embedded with flex sensors, users can operate devices like lights and fans, or signal needs like “eat,” “bathroom,” or “take medicine.” The system displays these requests on an LCD or mobile app for caretakers.

Who Can Benefit:

People with disabilities – those with limited mobility or speech difficulties

Elderly individuals – to communicate needs easily and safely

Healthcare staff – to provide better care in hospitals and elderly homes

Children with special needs – to assist in expressing their requirements

This project promotes independent living, enhances safety, and improves caregiver response through intuitive gesture-based communication.
